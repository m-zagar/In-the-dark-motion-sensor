# In-the-dark motion sensor
A project for the "Embedded computer systems" class. (Undergraduate University Study of Computing)

The goal of the project was to roughly simulate an in-the-dark motion sensor using ATmega16a microprocessor, it's development board, a BISS0001
micro power PIR motion sensor and a GL55 series photoresistor. 

The idea was setting up the modules so that the motion sensor would start picking up signals only when a certain amount of light was being emitted.

The project was successfully completed alongside colleagues Dominik Premelč and Renato Štrbac.
